# Kripke Frames in modal logic
## Lan formalisation project
### by Matej Jazbec


This Lean project is part of the coursework for the [Formalized Mathematics and Proof Assistants](https://www.andrej.com/zapiski/MAT-FORMATH-2024/book/) course.

The scope of the project is the formalisation of Kripke frames, the modal operators $\square$, $\diamond$ and characterise some of the most relevant modal logic axioms. A detailed project plan is exposed in the project [blueprint](https://github.com/MatejJazbec/kripke-frames/blob/main/blueprint/src/print.pdf).
